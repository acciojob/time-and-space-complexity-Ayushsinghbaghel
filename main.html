     <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>Time complexity is a measure used to evaluate the efficiency of an algorithm. It refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size. By analyzing time complexity, we can determine how well an algorithm performs in terms of execution speed, which helps in choosing the most efficient algorithm for a given problem.</p>

    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the input size. For example, if an algorithm's memory usage grows linearly with the input size, it is said to have a space complexity of O(n). This is crucial for understanding how an algorithm will scale in terms of memory consumption, especially for large data sets.</p>
